# WalkHomeSafe
An Emergency Text Scheduler
An emergency message schedule application for those who dont have access during that urgent time.

OUR GOAL
We created a website to help the user feel more safe on their commute,
whether its to work, school, or somewhere new.

WHY
Our target audience are students such as ourselves and especially 
women walking alone at night.

FUTURE HOPE
We hope this tech we bring more comfort to the user and put them to ease on their
walk back home.

DEMOING
We attempted to get user interface designed in a straightforward way and hopefully able to understand the need for each input.
The desination is used to get the estimated time from your current location to end goal.
THe emergency contact is to the user's choosing.
The ETA(evaluated time avaiable) is how much time you want to wait after the ETA before sending the message, for more personalifcation.
A urgent messege will be sent in that amount of time.

TOOLS
we built the app with a variety of web dev programs (HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP).
IT was great to be exposed to these languages that we only touched on them before.

The real challenge was deciding between PHP and js for better writability in the
backend.
THese challenges helped us learn in our mistakes. We learned to keep trying new ideas and methods to solve them eventually.
This was the most rewarding aspect.
The use of APIS such as geolocation for current location and Matrix for distance helped us to learn more about API's
in general and the functionaility. 
Twilio was also used as well to send messaging. Learning how to combine all these different tools into one, was
a bit ambiguous and had a lot of overlaps. However, it helped teach us what to do and not to do.
In the end our begining idea became very different than our finished product, but
it gave more realisic expectations as well for future plans.

END
Anything can happen, whether its adventuring out somewhere forign or the same routine.
We hope that no matter what stitution, you dont have to worry about someone elses misdeeds with this app.

FUTURE
We hope to expand the contents, improve on readability and writeability of the code.
We also want this to become a more reliable tool to others by having more implementation and more ways 
to access the application.
